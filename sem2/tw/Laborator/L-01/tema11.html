            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Years after Adonis Creed made a name for himself under Rocky Balboa's mentorship, the young boxer
                becomes the Heavyweight Champion of the World. While life is good with that victory and his marriage to
                Bianca, trouble comes to Philadelphia when Ivan Drago, the Russian boxer who killed Adonis' father,
                Apollo,
                arrives with his son, Viktor, to challenge Adonis. Against Rocky's advice, Adonis accepts the challenge
                without his mentor's participation and pays the price in a punishing bout he wins only by a
                technicality. Now injured and demoralized, Adonis cannot bring himself to back into the game, leaving
                his spirit and title in jeopardy. Together, Adonis' family and Rocky must find a way to rekindle Adonis'
                fighting spirit to face the future in whatever choice he makes. Meanwhile, the Drago family have its own
                troubles trying to regain the respect in their homeland that they lost at Rocky's hands as they wonder
                whether is it truly worth it.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)

                <h3>We Need a Viktor and Ivan Drago Spin Off</h3>
                <p>Rating: 7/10⭐</p>

                    This movie is not as good as the first Creed. It felt like a remake of Rocky 3 and was just too
                    formulaic. However what made the movie for me was the final scenes where my appreciation of the
                    movie changed by simply seeing the final round from the perspective of the Dragos and the aftermath
                    of the fight with the Drago's. <br><br>

                    Adonis is done for, his story arc is ove and I don't want there to be more for him. He is happy and
                    complete. Rocky's story is now done too. But Ivan and Viktor Drago were the only interesting people
                    in this movie. And I simply want to see what happens to them both now after this ending. <br><br>

                    I want to see them pick up the pieces and be successful. They've earned it after the ending which
                    was unheard of in a movie of this type. <br><br>

                    Please Sly and Dolph make it happen.

                <h3>Great: continues in the same vein as the first movie</h3>

                    Adonis Creed is heavyweight champion of the world. To defend his title, he accepts a challenge from
                    someone with a very close connection to Creed: Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago, the man who
                    killed Creed's father Apollo in the ring. Ivan is coaching his son and is determined to win the belt
                    that Rocky took from him. Viktor Drago is unstoppable and Creed's odds against him are slim.
                    <br><br>

                    To my surprise, I enjoyed the first Creed movie. I was never a fan of the Rocky movies and I figured
                    Creed was just going to be Rocky rebooted. <br><br>

                    Turns out it was better than that. Rather than style over substance it had character depth and good
                    plot development. The characters were engaging and the story was interesting. <br><br>

                    Creed II continues in the same vein with an interesting plot and decently drawn characters. Maybe
                    not as engaging as the first movie, but the intrigue of the David vs Goliath battle between Creed
                    and Drago makes up for that. <br><br>

                    Like the first Creed, this movie ties in with a Rocky storyline, so once again we have a refreshing
                    of the Rocky story and a handing over to the new Rocky, Creed. <br><br>

                <h3>Weak all over</h3>

                    Creed 2 (my personal 3 key points): <br><br>

                    *A boxing movie with 10 minutes of boxing+training and 2 hours of talking and deciding things. <br><br>

                    *Nearly a copy paste of Rocky 4 and if you thought that that fight was unrealistic, wait for this
                    one.<br><br>

                    *When Rocky was fighting in his movies even against a Russian I wholeheartedly wanted him to win
                    because he came from nothing, struggled and had spirit. Adonis acts like boxing is his hobby, I just
                    cant feel for him.<br><br>

                    I cant say more without spoiling... But very weak overall
